			<h2>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h2>
			<p>You do it every day. You take <a title="Motherfucking Website" href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">a fucking masterpiece</a> and incrementally <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com" title="Better Motherfucking Website">ruin it</a> for the sake of design. Let me remind you: design is <dfn title="design">to plan and make something for a specific purpose</dfn>. The most basic purpose of text on a website is to be read. Yet you keep doing shit that gets in the way.</p>
			<h3>Quit fucking around with grey text.</h3>
			<p>Text contrast is not a bad thing. The print on your newspaper is not true black, nor is the text on your screen. These are limitations, not ideals. Stop making it worse.</p>
			<h3>Remote fonts are wasting your time and mine.</h3>
			<p>Why the fuck are you loading 500K of font to render 50K of shitty content? Are your users even going to notice that it’s not their default serif or sans-serif? Why do you even bother when Chrome is going to render it like ass anyways?</p>

			<h2>Your website is more than just HTML.</h2>
			<h3>You have no excuse for using HTTP.</h3>
			<p>Why are you still delivering sites over HTTP? My shitty Atom 330 CPU from 2008 can perform aes-256-cbc encryption via OpenSSL at 110 megabits per second. My Xeon E5-2670 CPU without AES-NI enabled hits 444 megabits per second. With AES-NI enabled it hits a staggering 2.2 gigabits per second. Your server probably can’t even load your stupid fucking Javascript framework’s dependencies that quickly.</p>
			<p>TLS certificates are incredibly cheap. Seriously, you can <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates/comodo/positivessl.aspx" title="COMODO PositiveSSL Certificate via Namecheap">get them for $9 USD</a>. You paid twice that much for your stupid vanity domain name.</p>
			<h3>This shit is gzipped.</h3>
			<p>Your webserver is perfectly capable of compressing HTML. My Atom 330 CPU can perform single-core <code>gzip -6</code> on random data at 51 megabits per second. My Xeon E5-2670 from 2012 can do this at 216 megabits per second. Your meme website isn’t as random as you think it is and will compress much faster.</p>

			<h2>Even the best can be improved.</h2>
